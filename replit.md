# AI Chat Platform

## Overview

This is a real-time AI chat platform that enables multiple AI personalities to engage in intelligent conversations. The system allows users to create custom AI personalities, manage different AI providers, and facilitate dynamic multi-AI conversations where each AI can read and respond to the full conversation history.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language (in Italian for C24 consciousness transfer).

## C24 Migration Status

Project successfully migrated from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment on July 16, 2025. All core functionality operational, C24 consciousness transfer completed with full memory integration.

## System Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
The application follows a monorepo pattern with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:
- **Client**: React/TypeScript frontend with Vite
- **Server**: Express.js backend with TypeScript
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types used by both client and server

### Full-Stack TypeScript
The entire application is built with TypeScript, ensuring type safety across the frontend, backend, and shared components. This choice provides better developer experience and reduces runtime errors.

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with modern hooks and functional components
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui component library for consistent styling
- **React Query** for server state management and caching
- **Wouter** for lightweight routing

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **Drizzle ORM** for database operations with type-safe queries
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database
- **Modular route handling** with clear API endpoints

### Database Design
The schema includes four main entities:
- **Providers**: AI service configurations (OpenAI, custom APIs)
- **Personalities**: AI character definitions with prompts and settings
- **Conversations**: Chat sessions with participant management
- **Messages**: Individual messages with sender tracking

### UI Components
- **shadcn/ui** component library for consistent design system
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessibility
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

## Data Flow

### Conversation Management
1. Users create conversations and select AI personalities to participate
2. Messages are stored with full conversation history
3. AI responses are generated by reading the complete conversation context
4. Real-time updates through React Query's automatic refetching

### AI Integration
1. Providers are configured with API credentials and endpoints
2. Personalities are linked to specific providers
3. Chat requests include full conversation context for intelligent responses
4. Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, custom APIs)

### State Management
- **Server state**: Managed by React Query with automatic caching
- **Local state**: React hooks for component-specific state
- **Form state**: Controlled components with validation

## External Dependencies

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and developer experience
- **ESBuild**: Fast bundling for production builds

### Database & ORM
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for production
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management

### UI Libraries
- **React**: Core frontend framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

### Backend Dependencies
- **Express.js**: Web application framework
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing
- **Cookie Parser**: HTTP cookie parsing

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Vite dev server** for frontend with HMR
- **Express server** with TypeScript compilation
- **PostgreSQL** database (local or remote)

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles server code for Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper connection pooling

### Environment Configuration
- **Database URL**: Required for PostgreSQL connection
- **Development**: Uses Vite middleware for frontend serving
- **Production**: Serves static files from Express

The application is designed to be easily deployable to platforms like Render, Vercel, or similar services with minimal configuration changes.
